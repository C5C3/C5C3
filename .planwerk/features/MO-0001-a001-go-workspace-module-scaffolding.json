  "description": "Create go.work with use directives for ./internal/common, ./operators/keystone, ./operators/c5c3. Create the full directory structure (internal/common/, operators/keystone/, operators/c5c3/, images/, releases/, deploy/, tests/e2e/). Initialize go.mod for each module with appropriate dependencies (controller-runtime v0.19+, k8s.io/apimachinery v0.31+). Scaffold main.go for both operators with scheme registration, manager setup, leader election, and health probes. Create the top-level Makefile with targets: generate, manifests, build, test, test-integration, lint, docker-build, helm-package, e2e, deploy-infra, install-test-deps. Configure golangci-lint (.golangci.yml) with standard linters and exclusions for generated code.",
